# QRCode-Generator

## Choose data encoding mode

The first step of creating QR-Code is to choose the type. This version supports numeric, alphanumeric and iso-8859-1 input text.

## Encoding data

The used QR-Code version depends on the length of input text. There are 40 different versions of QR-Code sizes. 
The user can choose one of four different error correction modes (L, M, Q, H).
The program chooses a suitable QR-Code version and an encoding mode for the given input string and converts it to a bitstring.
